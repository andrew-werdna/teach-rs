# Intent 

Teach-rs is meant to be collection of teaching material about the Rust programming language for use in higher education (whether that be universities focused on theoretical science, educuational institutes of applied science, or higher vocational education). More broadly, it is intended to be also useful in any form of formal or informal classroom education (e.g. community colleges).

It is not a *course in rust*, but rather meant to be used by teachers to *create* a course in Rust tailored to the needs of their students. Hence the name: **teach-rs**. That means that we expect (and encourage) every course that is taught using teach-rs to make different selections of material.

The goal of this project is therefore for teach-r to consist of:

- Exercise material: exercise instructions and templates.
- A master slide deck for use in lectures.
- Tools to help teachers easily make selections of material that make sure that essential parts are not skipped.

What is not in scope of teach-rs:

- The equivalent of a "book", i.e. reading material; good external resources exist both on line and in book form. We do want to have a section on collecting all of those.

- Being usable as a self-teaching aid. That is not to say that the material contained in this repository cannot be used to become self-taught in Rust, but that is not the primary mission.

- Solutions to exercises. Some of our exercises are open-ended and have multiple correct solutions. In line with being meant for use in higher education, students should reflect on their solutions themselves, discuss their work with their peers or receive feedback from their teacher/teaching assistants. The Rust compiler itself also lends itself well as a teaching aid: it will catch many mistakes and suggest improvements; i.e. various exercises may try to steer students into interaction with Rust compiler messages.

The material is free for any purpose (licensed under CC-BY-SA). It is highly appreciated that changes/improvements are contributed back to us, even if the license doesn't necessarily demand it.

Great that you want to contribute to teach-rs! Here's some ways in which you can help improve the project.

## Improving the material
If you see anything you think can easily be improved with a small pull request, such as fixing typos, fixing links or re-formulating sentences, please open a PR directly.

If you want to propose a structural change to one or more modules, please open an issue first, so we can discuss your ideas.
Please clearly state your proposed changes and your motivation for suggesting the changes. In case an improvement proposal is accepted, a PR with the changes referring to the relevant issue can be made.

## Adding a module
Teach-rs is intended to be used as a basis for custom courses that either are about Rust itself or use Rust to teach some other concept.
To that end, the teach-rs project aims to incorporate modules on diverse topics.

If you feel teach-rs should cover a topic that is currently not covered, you can propose adding a module by opening an issue.
State the main goal and the learning objectives of the module, as well as the covered topics and proposed exercises.
In case an addition proposal is accepted, a PR with the proposed changes referring to the relevant issue can be opened.

Have a look at the structure of the current slides and exercises to get a better understanding of how modules are organized.

## Trying it out on your students
Teach-rs is distributed under a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, so even if you don't have the time to contribute to this repository directly, you are free to teach from it
and to adapt its material to suit your students' needs. You can also help the development of teach-rs by communicating your experiences---what modules did your students like, which ones did they struggle with?

Just open an issue and don't forget to mention (without going into personal details) what the background of your students is and which parts of the course you used.
